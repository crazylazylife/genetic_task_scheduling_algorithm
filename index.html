<h1>A Genetic Algorithm for Task Scheduling</h1>

<h2>By Sean Strickland, Theisen Sanders</h2>

<h3>Computer Science 472<br>Iowa State University</h3>

<h4>Project Description</h4>

<p>Our project idea is to develop a genetic algorithm for task selection/scheduling. A general
    overview is that we would like to make a genetic algorithm that can take a large set of tasks,
    some constraints, a set of resources, and outputs a subset of the given tasks (as a sequence)
    that meets the constraints and efficiently utilizes the resources. One possible use case for
    this is as a scheduler for a group of servers pulling tasks from a task pool.</p>

<p>A more concrete description is that each task could have a duration (amount of time it takes), an
    amount of resources it uses (think of it as cost), a priority value (think of it as reward for
    doing the task), and a set of prerequisite tasks that must be completed before this task can be
    performed. The input is a set of these tasks and the amount of time and resources available to
    perform the tasks. The output is a subset of the given tasks that efficiently uses the time and
    resources while not going over or violating prerequisite requirements. Additionally, users could
    set a number of generations they want the algorithm to run for (a larger number of generations
    yields a better result). The tricky part of this project will be developing a fitness function
    that can accurately determine the efficiency of a given schedule.

<p>

<p>These details are flexible at the moment and there are many ways we could add to or change the
    properties of a task. We would like to make a web application that allows a user to construct
    the set of tasks and provide other inputs like a maximum running time, maximum number of
    generations, and/or a "seed sequence" that could be used to influence what the result might look
    like. The goal being to help others visualize and understand how genetic algorithms work.</p>
</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>
<ul>
    <li>To develop an efficient algorithm for determining an optimized task schedule</li>
    <li>To create a web application that provides simple inputs for tasks and constraints, and
        outputs the resulting schedule
    </li>
    <li>Provides a mechanism for helping users understand how the genetic algorithm operates</li>
</ul>

<h4>Approach</h4>
<h5>Algorithm</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Inputs = Tasks + Contraints + Algorithm Inputs(total generations)
    </li>
    <li>Constraints
        <ul>
            <li>Hard
                <ul>
                    <li>Procedural - the dependecies each task has on other tasks
                    </li>
                    <li>Temporal - any time constraints put on each task
                    </li>
                    <li>Resource - The number of processors that can run tasks
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Soft
                <ul>
                    <li>Total Time constraint - the time it takes for the longest running
                        processor
                    </li>
                    <li>Throughput - the sum of all the end times of each task</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Solution/Genome - a solution will be represented by a list of processors and the order in
        which
        tasks run on each processor.
    </li>
    <li>Fitness function
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Tools</h5>

<ul>
    <li>Genetic Algorithm
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Web Framework for input/output

    and efficiently generate a task schedule using a genetic algorithm</p>
