<h4>Project Description</h4>

<p>Our project idea is to develop a genetic algorithm for task scheduling. A general
    overview is that we would like to make a genetic algorithm that can take a large set of tasks,
    some constraints, a number of resources to run the tasks on, and outputs a schedule for
    running the tasks on the resources that efficiently uses time and resources while not violating
    any hard constraints. One possible use case for this is as a scheduler for a group of servers
    pulling tasks from a task pool.</p>

<p>A more concrete description is that each task could have a duration (amount of time it takes to
    execute), a priority value, and a set of prerequisite tasks (dependencies) that must be
    completed before this task can be executed. The input is a set of these tasks and the number of
    resources available to execute the tasks. The output is a list of resources and the order in
    which tasks are run on each resource. Additionally, users could set a number of generations
    they want the algorithm to run for (a larger number of generations yields a better result).
    The tricky part of this project will be developing a genome representation of a schedule and
    a fitness function that can accurately determine the efficiency of a given genome/schedule.</p>

<p>These details are flexible at the moment and there are many ways we could add to or change the
    properties of a task. We would like to make a web application that allows a user to construct
    the set of tasks and provide other inputs like a maximum running time, maximum number of
    generations, and/or a "seed sequence" that could be used to influence what the result might look
    like. The goal being to help others visualize and understand how genetic algorithms work.</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>
<ul>
    <li>To develop an efficient algorithm for determining an optimized task schedule</li>
    <li>To create a web application that provides simple inputs for tasks and constraints, and
        outputs the resulting schedule
    </li>
    <li>Provides a mechanism for helping users understand how the genetic algorithm operates</li>
</ul>

<h4>Approach</h4>
<h5>Algorithm</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Inputs - The tasks to schedule, constraints on the possible schedules, and algorithm
        specific inputs such as max generations, timeout, and/or seed.
    </li>
    <li>Constraints
        <ul>
            <li>Hard (if genome does not satisfy, it cannot reproduce)
                <ul>
                    <li>Procedural - The dependencies each task has on other tasks. If task T1
                        is dependent on task T2, then this constraint prevents T1 from being
                        scheduled before T2 is complete.
                    </li>
                    <li>Temporal - The time constraints put on each task, such as task T1 must
                        be completed before time 10.
                    </li>
                    <li>Resource - Analogous to the number of processors available to run tasks.
                        If there are X resources/processors available then up to X tasks can be
                        executing at any time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Soft (genomes that best satisfy these constraints will be more likely to reproduce)
                <ul>
                    <li>Total Time - The time it takes for the longest running processor
                        to finish executing tasks.
                    </li>
                    <li>Prioritized Throughput - The sum of all the end times of each task,
                        weighted by their priority.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Solution/Genome - A solution will be represented by a list of resources and the order in
        which tasks run on each resource.
    </li>
    <li>Reproduction - Creating new solutions from two old solutions by randomly choosing a
        crossover index and swapping the tasks after that index in each resource of one solution
        with the tasks after that index in each resource of the other solution.
    </li>
    <li>Fitness Function - A function applied to each generating that "sterilizes" solutions that
        violate any hard constraints and rewards solutions that measure well in terms of the soft
        constraints with a chance to reproduce.
    </li>
</ul>
